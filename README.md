# Coffee_shop_analysis
Coffee is the most popular drink worldwide. Curious about the coffee business, then i discovered that 2.25 billion cups of coffee are consumed daily around the world. 
This made me curious about how coffee shops operate, such as peak consumption times—whether more people drink coffee in the morning or evening—and how much revenue a coffee shop owner can generate. I found a relevant dataset on the Maven website, imported the data into Excel's Power Query, and conducted further analysis.
